# A-Worldwide-Exploration-of-Depression---Understanding-the-Factors
This project analyzes global mental health and depression through clustering and regression models, focusing on socio-economic and health factors. Key variables like anxiety, unemployment, and alcohol consumption were found to influence depression rates. Conclusions highlight distinct country clusters, showing that high economic development doesn't guarantee better mental health, with issues like anxiety and bipolarism prevalent in wealthier nations, while depression is more common in lower-income countries.
